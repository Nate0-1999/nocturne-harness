# Verification

Judge-owned milestone evidence belongs under `verification/<milestone>/`.
Agent Zero reserves that structure and carries forward the governing law.

The current integration handoff is
[`verification/i1/README.md`](i1/README.md). It maps the I1 builder dry run,
the evidence that passed, and the remaining C.8/SOP closure gaps. I1 is
currently returned TODO; this is not an independent judge verdict.

## SPEC B.6 — Verification doctrine (judge law), verbatim

> A milestone is DONE when a judge agent, acting as the user, experiences every
> acceptance criterion — never merely when code exists or unit tests pass.
>
> 1. **Three evidence classes, all mandatory, per criterion:**
>    - **Experiential:** drive the real UI as a user (browser automation or
>      manual): real clicks, real prompts, screenshots at every meaningful
>      state. If it can't be screenshotted being used, it isn't done.
>    - **Traced:** follow the SAME action through the internals — log lines,
>      DB rows, API payloads — and prove they agree with the surface (e.g. the
>      injection_id visible in the gate maps to injection_event rows whose
>      features/outcomes match what the screenshot shows).
>    - **Adversarial:** deliberately trigger the failure paths named by the
>      criterion (kill dependencies, force 409s, go offline) and verify the
>      specified degradation, not a crash.
> 2. **Separation of powers:** the judge is a distinct agent from the builders
>    of the loop it judges (no self-certification). Judges do not fix — a FAIL
>    returns to the builders with the verdict; the Blight Protocol governs the
>    fix.
> 3. **Verdict artifacts:** screenshots, log excerpts, and SQL outputs are
>    committed under `verification/<milestone>/` ; the verdict file lists each
>    criterion → PASS/FAIL → evidence paths → tree node. Any FAIL = milestone
>    not done.
> 4. **Scope audit is judgeable:** the judge greps for FORBIDDEN-feature code
>    (B.4) and verifies every DECISIONS.md entry cites a tree node. Scope
>    violations are automatic FAILs regardless of functionality.
> 5. **Responsive law is judged:** experiential passes are repeated at a phone
>    viewport (390×844) for all user-facing criteria.
> 6. Each milestone's concrete checklist is authored at milestone planning
>    time from this doctrine (M1's is C.9).
